# Total Matching: Models and Algorithms

This repository contains the exprimental source code for computing a maximum total matching in a graph G=(V,E), using the valid inequalities introduced in:

* L. Ferrarini, S. Gualandi. **Total Coloring and Total Matching: Polyhedra and Facets**. [arxiv:2105.09827](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09827)

The code published here is currently *work-in-progress*.
